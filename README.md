# Command-line-args
A C++ console application that accepts command-line arguments and then displays each argument on a new line
This is based on example 1.19 from "An Introduction to Design Patterns in C++ with Qt, 2nd Edition" by Alan Ezust and Paul Ezust

## Instructions
- Build the clargs.cpp file using g++ ```g++ clargs.cpp -o clargs```
- Test the application with command line arguments: ```./clargs spam eggs "space wars" 123```
